<h1>Prodigy Infotech Software Development Internship</h1>

<p>This repository contains the micro projects assigned by Prodigy Infotech during my internship in the software engineering domain. I was assigned five projects, out of which I have successfully completed four. Below are the details of each completed project:</p>

<h2>Completed Projects</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>PRODIGY_SD_1: Temperature Conversion Program</h3>
    <p>This project involves writing a program to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It's a fundamental exercise in understanding conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations.</p>
